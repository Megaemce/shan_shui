This is the third iteration of this app:

1. Firstly created as a [monolithic JavaScript file](https://github.com/LingDong-/shan-shui-inf) by [Lingdong Huang](https://github.com/LingDong-)
2. Then it was [rebuilt with React 17](https://github.com/RedContritio/shan_shui_inf) by [RedContritio](https://github.com/RedContritio).
3. I have rebuilt it using modern React components, employing an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach for enhanced performance. Additionally, I have addressed several bugs and incorporated various improvements.
