This is the third iteration of this app. 
Firstly, it was created as a [monolithic JavaScript file](https://github.com/LingDong-/shan-shui-inf) by [Lingdong Huang](https://github.com/LingDong-) and then it was [rebuilt with React](https://github.com/RedContritio/shan_shui_inf) by [RedContritio](https://github.com/RedContritio).
