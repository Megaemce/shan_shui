## üìú Versions

This is the third iteration of this app:

1. Firstly created as a [monolithic JavaScript file](https://github.com/LingDong-/shan-shui-inf) by [Lingdong Huang](https://github.com/LingDong-)
2. Then it was [rebuilt with React 17](https://github.com/RedContritio/shan_shui_inf) by [RedContritio](https://github.com/RedContritio) without changing the source code
3. I have rebuilt it using React function components, employing an object-oriented programming approach. Additionally, I have addressed several bugs and incorporated various improvements for enhanced performance and readability:

    - Dark mode was added,
    - Some of the most complex elements were simplified,
    - Whole code was rewritten and commented using JSDoc,
    - [Fastest way to work with array](https://annoyscript.vercel.app/posts/The%20fastest%20way%20to%20work%20with%20arrays/) was implemented wherever it was reasonable,
    - Invisible objects are removed from the DOM for faster rendering and lower memory consumption,
    - Designing and rendering is done via [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) and [promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) for parallel computation, preventing [main thread blockages](https://web.dev/articles/optimize-long-tasks?utm_source=devtools).
